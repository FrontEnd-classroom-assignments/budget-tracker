# Expense Tracker Assignment

Create a simple Expense Tracker built with React and TypeScript.
## Step 1
Step one can be started after the TodoList is implemented in the course

### Features
- Add expenses with description, amount, type (income/outcome), and date
- Validation to ensure all fields are filled and the amount is a valid number
- View a list of all expenses in a table
- Delete expenses
- Type-safe code using TypeScript

**Note:** If the selected type is **outcome**, the amount should be saved as a negative value.

### Usage
1. Enter a description, amount, date, and select the type (income or outcome).
2. Click **Add Expense** to add it to the table.
3. View all expenses in the table below. Use the **Delete** button to remove an expense.

### Bonus
- Display the current saldo (total balance) on the page, calculated as the sum of all expense amounts.
- Monthly limit and alert.

## Step 2
Step two can be started after the Material UI is studied in the course

- Replace the current date input field in the Expense Tracker with the MUI-X Date Picker (https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-picker/).
- In the table where expense entries are listed, format the displayed date in format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
